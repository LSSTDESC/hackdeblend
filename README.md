Hack 'de Blend: A Deblending Task Force Hack

## Motivation

This repository is a space for developing and executing a bite-sized project contributing to the efforts of the LSST-DESC Deblending Task Force.  A strong possibility is to use @esheldon's catalogs to explore the relationships between bias and other parameters.  The files in question can be found at /global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/users/esheldon/nbrsim-outputs/collated/ on NERSC.
